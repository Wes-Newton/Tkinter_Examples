# Tkinter_Examples
This is a collection of tkinter example files.
This repository of tkinter examples files is a collection of example programs from
various sources such as Stackoverflow, on-line tutorials, the book "Modern
Tkinter for Busy Python Developers" my Mark Roseman.  Most of the examples
have been reworked in some way to include additional features or widgets.
Most examples are Object Oriented.
Thanks to all who initated these examples.  When possible the original source is 
referenced.  It is my intent to keep this as a basis for utilizing parts in
larger applications.
